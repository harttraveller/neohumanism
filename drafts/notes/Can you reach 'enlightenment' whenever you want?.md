;If you could, maybe it would come from a sudden recognition of the dual fact that:

1) You haven't been taking life seriously enough
2) You have have been taking life too seriously

You haven't been taking life seriously enough. The potential that resides within you to alter the path of the universe is massive.

The form you are currently in is only going to going to get this one chance. It is critically important that you use it as best you can, in the service of others, and in service of yourself, the deepest parts of your [[Redefining what the "soul" is within a scientific context|soul]].

At the same time, you also have been taking life too seriously.
