Neohumanism encourages criticism. There is no rule or idea that should not be criticized. Indeed, even the core directive of neohumanism can be criticized, and should be. The key difference between the core directive of neohumanism, and all other directives and ideas, is if that one believes they have successfully criticized anything but the core directive, forming a branch, they can still call that branch neohumanism.

If one belives they have successfully criticized the core directive, and branches off neohumanism, then it can no longer be called 'neohumanism'. I mean, you can still call it that, if you want to, but I (Hart) personally won't think of you as a neohumanist.
