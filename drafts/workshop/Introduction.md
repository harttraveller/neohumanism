How does the neohumanism project work?

I'm attempting to create a consistent philosophical/religious framework that is internally consistent, and optimized for the third millenium (and perhaps beyond, though)

If you disagree with something in the religion you can submit an issue on github. 

You can think of this like an original religious text, but one which is not created by one person, but rather, by many different people. The optimal goal is that by pooling human consciousness, the resulting text will be far better, more internally consistent, and closer to "truth" than it would be otherwise. Specifically, the goal is that the text gets to the point wherein as the majority of people who read this, as they read it, 

The structure for the resolution of disagreements is still being explored, but several paths are being explored.

- Nicean councels. Voting percentage for approving a new pull request is proportional to the number of previous approved pull requests. 
	- Doing this, at first glance, would make it an inherently conservative religion. People who have successfully merged many pull requests would be incentivized to not merge more pull requests.
	- Maybe? But also, the branching system exists. Thus, if one super-contributor monopolizes voting power, someone else can create a branch, thus instantly becoming the super-contributor for that branch. Thus, the system incentives evolution.
	- The most successful branches of neohumanism will be the ones which adapt best to the cultural standards of the societies within which they coexist. The most successful branches will be those created by enclaves that are committed to democratic governance of the branch, as non-democratic governance will lead to monopolization of power, slower evolution, and thus, branches that are monopolized by centralized authoritarian super-contributors will evolve slower, and be outcompeted by smaller branches that can evolve faster.
	- Because of the adaptibility, neohumanism is not exclusive. You can be a christian/jewish/muslim/buddhist neohumanist, or whatever you choose.

If your disagreement is not approved you can create a "branch" - no, literally! You can clone the neobible and create your own branch.

For instance, suppose that hypothetically neohumanism had a list of 7 sins (currently, it does not).

If you thought that the seventh sin was not really a sin, you could bring it up as an issue on GitHub, or you could create a branch, make the change, and then submit a pull request to merge the branch back in. If your branch is not approved by the existing neohumanist council, you can take your branch, and form a perfectly valid branch of neohumanism, for which you are now the super-contributor with executive rights (if you choose to keep the current command structure of neohumanism:B42)

You are encouraged, however, to first spend some time making a case to the existing neohumanist council on the branch you intended to submit your change to. 


**This religion is one which constantly evolves, which *you* can change, if you see fit to do so.  It is designed to evolve over time, splitting into different branches that compete with each other for dominance - living across the minds of humanity.**

### There is only one thing which *all* branches of neohumanism must have. It is perhaps analagous to the 10 commandments, except it was decided that only one was needed, and it is not so much a commandment as a core philosophical directive, open to interpretation. With that said, there is a mathematically rigorous justification for why it is the right thing to do included in this text. It is the following:

# Maximize universal freedom.
