# TLDR

Neohumanism is a religion with a singular core directive:

***Maximize Universal Freedom***

The definition of "freedom" and the statement itself are rigorously mathematically defined within the texts.

Because the religion is [hosted on GitHub](https://www.github.com/harttraveller/neohumanism), if you disagree with something you can fork the sacred texts, make some changes, and submit a pull request. 

If your pull request is denied, then you can literally and figuratively create a branch. Thus, the religion evolves by way of natural selection. 

In order to keep the title 'neohumanism' any branch must at a minimum, however, maintain the core directive.
